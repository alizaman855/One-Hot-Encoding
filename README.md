# One Hot Encoding

One hot encoding is one method of converting data to prepare it for an algorithm and get a better prediction. With one-hot, we convert each categorical value into a new categorical column and assign a binary value of 1 or 0 to those columns. Each integer value is represented as a binary vector.
